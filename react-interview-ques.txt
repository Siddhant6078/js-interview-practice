🔹 Core React Fundamentals (Q1–5)
These cover the basics every React engineer must know:

Display dynamic HTML data in React
Send data from parent → child component
Call a parent method from a child component
Access a DOM element in React (refs)
Bind an array/array of objects to a dropdown
💡 Hint: Expect to use props, refs, and array mapping frequently here.

🔹 Rendering & State Management (Q6–13)
Create a lazy-loaded component
Display user input in another textbox
Loop through arrays/objects in React
Conditionally render element/text
Change styles dynamically based on conditions
Show/hide elements with conditional rendering
Bind array/objects to radio buttons
Display selected radio value in a textbox
💡 Hint: Employers check your fluency with map(), useState, and conditional rendering patterns.

🔹 Lifecycle & Re-rendering (Q14–19)
Call a method when the component first renders
Display keys/values of an object in a loop
Re-render component on value change
Call a method on every re-render
Add data to a useState array
Build a search filter textbox
💡 Hint: Understand useEffect, key props, and state immutability.

🔹 Hooks in Action (Q20–27)
Counter using useState
Counter using useReducer
Enable/disable textbox from a parent button
Implement debouncing in React
Fetch data from an API (custom component)
Force re-render without using useState
Call a method immediately after a state update
Show a remaining character counter in a textarea using useRef
💡 Hint: React hooks are the heart of L1/L2 interviews — expect questions on useState, useEffect, useReducer, and useRef.

🔹 Advanced React Scenarios (Q28–39)
Implement dependent dropdowns (Country → State)
Add type checking with prop-types
Share data across components with Context API
Optimize performance with useMemo
Optimize callbacks with useCallback
Create an Error Boundary
Show dropdown value in a textbox
Create a Pure Component
Explain Controlled vs Uncontrolled components
Build a custom React hook
Create a popup using React Portal
Compare lifecycle methods in class components vs useEffect
💡 Hint: These scenarios test your understanding of optimization, patterns, and system design in React.

🔹 Scaling React Apps (Q40–41)
Build a pagination component
Safeguard a React application (security best practices)
